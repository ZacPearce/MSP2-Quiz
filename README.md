# Business Goal

- ### Increase Public Interaction and Bring In More Customers

I aim to do this by offering a chance to win a free weekend at any of our hotels across the nation with all expenses paid and all they have to do is answer a simple question and leave their contact information.


# UX (User Experience)

The User will be able to easily navigate through the site, whether they want to check out what the hotel is about, see the facilities of what we have to offer  via the photo gallery or book a room, it is all easy to find and can be accessed without any issues.

They can find all relevant information needed to get in touch with us or allow them to just search through the site and find out whatever they need about us.

## User stories

# Design

For the design I used  Beige colour as I feel it's welcoming and not very aggressive, I used black and gray to compliment the beige. I used the same colours throughout the site to keep in line with the theme of the colour scheme without it being too overbearing. The only time I used a different colour was Red and that was to highlight our competition.

# Typography

### *Times Roman*
 I used Times Roman as I feel it's easy to read and it also stays with the theme of Kendrick Lamar's album 'DAMN.' 

# Structure


## Header

- In the header of each page I have gave the page a unique title and I've hyperlinked our club mascot 'the warthog' next to the title as a return to home button.

## Home Page

- You're welcomed to the page with a smile, the hero image is our home pitch but styled into a smiley face to make it more welcoming.

- Under the header and slogan, there's a navigation bar.

- Underneath the navigation bar, I've made a simple design that gives you all the information on our ethos, what we believe to be important and the inspiration of how we started, while adding images to give you a feel of what the hotel is like.

- I've put a link to the competition in our introduction to promote it, the more people who sign up the better because they have to give us their information to enter

## Rooms

- I've made a list of amenities to show everything we have to offer and what comes with the room when you book with us 

### King Room & Queen Room
- I've made two additional pages within the Rooms page showing our King room and our Queen room, so you can see what each of our room types look like and you can pick your prefences, I've also added a link to the bookings page if they like what they see they can quickly find a way to book.

## Bookings

- I have created an easy to fill out booking form with the price at the top and clearly visible

- I also put the competition form next to the booking form because if you book, they are more inclined to just fill it out while they're there and if you're their for the competition, they might be tempted to book a room once they see our great prices.

## Contact Us

- The contact us page is a simple but essential page for our business, it tells the user where we are and how to get here via all forms of transportation.

- I've put all contact information on this page, phone number, the address and e-mail address, while having a subheader that lets them know we open to calls 24/7 answer any queries they have.

- I've put also put a map of our location on the contact page so they can see it.

- I've put the opening date of all our new branches across the country on here too.
